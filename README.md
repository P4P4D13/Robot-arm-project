Hello, not much ago, ive started learning Roboguide and made this project using the ER-4ia which is the robot i use in site
what the robot does its moving a cyclinder piece through any wholes, i later designed a program that moves the cyclinder in which ever hole i want using a calibtration sheet and refered to every position as a position in a matrix
if you want to check the project you need to have roboguide installed and every item to be in the same folder as the project
